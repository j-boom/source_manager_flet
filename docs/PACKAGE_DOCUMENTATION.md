### 4. Installation and Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

#### Installation Steps
1. Extract the project files to your desired location
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flet run src/main.py
   ```

#### First Launch
- The application will create necessary directories automatically
- A first-time setup dialog will appear for new users
- User preferences and project data are stored locally

### 5. Application Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **Entry Point** (`src/main.py`)
   - Application initialization
   - Logging setup
   - Window configuration
   - Error handling

2. **Application Controller** (`src/controllers/app_controller.py`)
   - Central orchestrator
   - Navigation management
   - Component coordination
   - Callback handling

3. **Manager Classes** (`src/models/`)
   - `UserConfigManager`: User preferences and settings
   - `ThemeManager`: UI theme and color management
   - `WindowManager`: Window state and positioning
   - `NavigationManager`: Page routing and navigation
   - `SettingsManager`: Application settings coordination
   - `ProjectStateManager`: Current project data management

4. **Services** (`src/services/`)
   - `DirectoryService`: File system operations
   - `ProjectCreationService`: Project creation workflow

5. **Views** (`src/views/`)
   - `MainView`: Application shell and layout
   - `BaseView`: Common view functionality
   - Page views for different application screens
   - Reusable components (dialogs, forms)

#### Data Flow
1. User interactions → AppController
2. AppController → Managers (state updates)
3. Managers → Services (business logic)
4. Services → Data persistence (JSON files)
5. State changes → View updates via callbacks

### 6. File Archive Structure

The provided `.zip` archive contains all source files converted to `.txt` format for easy viewing and analysis:

- **source_manager_flet_txt_archive.zip**: Complete project with all files as `.txt`
- Original file structure is preserved
- All Python, JSON, Markdown, and configuration files included
- Can be extracted and file extensions changed back to originals for execution

### 7. Key Files for Review

#### Core Application Files
- `src/main.py.txt` - Application entry point
- `src/controllers/app_controller.py.txt` - Main application logic
- `src/views/main_view.py.txt` - Primary UI layout

#### Configuration
- `config/data_models.py.txt` - Data structures and serialization
- `config/app_config.py.txt` - Application constants
- `requirements.txt.txt` - Python dependencies

#### Documentation
- `docs/COMPLETE_APPLICATION_DOCUMENTATION.md.txt` - Comprehensive documentation
- `docs/project_structure.txt.txt` - Project structure overview
- `docs/README.md.txt` - Quick start guide
