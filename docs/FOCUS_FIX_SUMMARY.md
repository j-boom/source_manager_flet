# Focus Fix Summary

## Issue Analysis
The field focus issue was caused by the container structure in the main application interfering with focus events.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Container Padding
**File:** `src/views/pages/project_view/project_view.py`
- Temporarily removed `padding=ft.padding.all(10)` from the tabs container
- This container was intercepting click events and preventing fields from receiving focus

### 2. Simplified Field Layout  
**File:** `src/views/pages/project_view/tabs/project_metadata.py`
- Removed unnecessary container wrappers around field widgets
- Fields are now added directly to the column layout without extra container layers
- Added spacing to the column instead of using container padding

### 3. Enhanced Field Properties
**File:** `src/views/pages/project_view/tabs/project_metadata.py`
- Added `autofocus=False` to prevent automatic focus conflicts
- Ensured proper read_only vs disabled properties for different widget types

## Testing
Created multiple tests to isolate the issue:
- Basic field comparison test ✅ (fields worked in isolation)
- Tab structure test ✅ (fields worked with simple tab structure)  
- Main app structure test ❌ (identified container padding as the culprit)

## Fix Results
- Fields are now properly focusable and editable in edit mode
- Click-to-focus works correctly
- Theme-appropriate colors display properly (white for editable, grey for read-only)
- Edit/view mode switching works smoothly

## Future Considerations
- Monitor if removing padding affects the visual layout
- Consider alternative layout approaches that don't interfere with focus
- May need to add padding in other ways if visual spacing is needed
