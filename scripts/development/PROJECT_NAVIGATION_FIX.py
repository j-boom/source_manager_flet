Project Creation Navigation Fix
==============================

PROBLEM:
When creating a new project, the app was navigating to a "current_project" page 
that the user doesn't want to see. Instead, it should go directly to the 
"project_view" page.

SOLUTION:
Changed the navigation target in the _on_project_created method from 
"current_project" to "project_view".

CHANGE LOCATION:
File: /src/views/pages/new_project_view_refactored.py
Method: _on_project_created()
Line: ~333

BEFORE:
    self.on_navigate("current_project")  # This will be handled by app controller

AFTER:
    self.on_navigate("project_view")  # Go directly to project view

FLOW:
1. User fills out project creation dialog
2. Project is successfully created and saved to database
3. Project data is loaded into app state (project_state_manager)
4. Navigation redirects to "project_view" (bypassing "current_project")
5. Project View displays the newly created project

BENEFITS:
âœ… Eliminates unwanted "current_project" page
âœ… Direct navigation to the desired Project View
âœ… Cleaner user experience
âœ… Maintains all existing functionality

TESTING:
- Navigation target verified as "project_view"
- App controller properly handles project_view navigation
- Existing UI navigation tests still pass
- Project state management unchanged
