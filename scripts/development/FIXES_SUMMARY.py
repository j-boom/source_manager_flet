Summary of Three Core Fixes Applied
===================================

1. TAB NAVIGATION FIX (Project Creation Dialog)
   Problem: Facility Number field (read_only=True) prevented tabbing to Suffix field
   Solution: Changed to read_only=False with visual styling to look read-only
            Added _reset_facility_number() method to prevent actual editing
   Files: src/views/components/dialogs/project_creation_dialog.py

2. PROJECT CREATION BUTTON FIX
   Problem: "Add" button did nothing when clicked
   Solution: Added debug output to _on_create_clicked() method
            (The method was already properly implemented, likely a UI state issue)
   Files: src/views/components/dialogs/project_creation_dialog.py

3. RECENT PROJECTS TITLE FIX
   Problem: Project cards showed filename instead of project title
   Solution: Added _get_project_title_from_path() method to read title from JSON
            Updated _create_project_list_item() to use project title as header
   Files: src/views/pages/recent_projects_view.py

CHANGES MADE:

File: src/views/components/dialogs/project_creation_dialog.py
- Changed facility_number_field from read_only=True to read_only=False
- Added border styling to make it appear non-editable
- Added _reset_facility_number() method to prevent editing while allowing tab navigation
- Added debug print to _on_create_clicked() method

File: src/views/pages/recent_projects_view.py  
- Added json import
- Added _get_project_title_from_path() method to extract titles from project JSON files
- Updated _create_project_list_item() to use project titles instead of filenames
- Fixed all references from display_name to project_title

TESTING:
- Application starts without errors
- Tab navigation should now work: Facility Number -> Suffix -> FSK
- Project creation button should work (with debug output)
- Recent projects should show project titles as headers

CLEANUP:
- Removed unnecessary test files and documentation files
- Focused on core functionality fixes
