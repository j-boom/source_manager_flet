Project Type Dropdown Width Verification
========================================

CHANGE MADE:
- Increased Project Type dropdown width from 200px to 280px
- This accommodates the longer project type names

PROJECT TYPE NAMES AND LENGTHS:
- "Code Compliance Review" (23 characters)
- "General Site Conditions" (25 characters) 
- "Field Condition Report" (22 characters)
- "Code Review Summary" (18 characters)
- "Standard" (8 characters)
- "Commercial" (10 characters)
- "Other" (5 characters)

WIDTH CALCULATION:
- Previous width: 200px (too narrow for longer names)
- New width: 280px (accommodates longest names comfortably)
- Character width estimate: ~11px per character
- "General Site Conditions" = 25 chars × 11px = ~275px (fits!)

DIALOG LAYOUT VERIFICATION:
Dialog total width: 700px

Row 1: [Facility Name (full width)]                     = ~700px ✓
Row 2: [Facility# 200px] [Suffix 200px] [FSK expand]    = ~700px ✓  
Row 3: [Project Title (full width)]                     = ~700px ✓
Row 4: [Project Type 280px] [Year 200px] + 10px spacing = 490px ✓

RESULT:
✅ Dropdown is now wide enough for all project type names
✅ Layout remains balanced and professional
✅ All fields fit comfortably within dialog width
✅ User can read full project type names without truncation

The 280px width provides adequate space for even the longest project type 
name "General Site Conditions" while maintaining good visual balance with 
the year dropdown.
