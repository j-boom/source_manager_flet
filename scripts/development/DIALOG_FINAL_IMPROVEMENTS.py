Project Creation Dialog - Final Improvements
===========================================

CHANGES MADE:

1. PROJECT TYPE DROPDOWN - FULL WORDS DISPLAY
   ✅ Before: Showed codes (CCR, GSC, STD, FCR, COM, CRS, OTH)
   ✅ After: Shows full descriptions:
      - "Code Compliance Review" → CCR in filename
      - "General Site Conditions" → GSC in filename  
      - "Standard" → STD in filename
      - "Field Condition Report" → FCR in filename
      - "Commercial" → COM in filename
      - "Code Review Summary" → CRS in filename
      - "Other" → OTH in filename

2. DOCUMENT TITLE REQUIREMENT REMOVED
   ✅ Before: OTH projects required a document title
   ✅ After: No project types require document title
   ✅ Document title field will never show (always hidden)

3. FILENAME GENERATION
   ✅ Uses codes in filename: "1234567890 - AB123 - STD - 2025.json"
   ✅ Even though dropdown shows "Standard", filename gets "STD"

FILES MODIFIED:

1. src/services/project_creation_service.py:
   - Updated PROJECT_TYPES to full word descriptions
   - Added PROJECT_TYPE_CODES mapping (display name → code)
   - Removed document title requirement for OTH projects
   - Updated generate_filename() to use codes
   - Updated validation to work with display names

2. src/views/components/dialogs/project_creation_dialog.py:
   - Added conversion from display name to code
   - Updated validation to use display names
   - Updated project creation to use codes for database/filename

TESTING SCENARIOS:

Scenario 1 - Standard Project:
1. User selects "Standard" from dropdown
2. Fills out required fields
3. Creates project
4. Filename: "1234567890 - AB123 - STD - 2025.json"
5. Database stores project_type as "STD"

Scenario 2 - Other Project:
1. User selects "Other" from dropdown
2. Fills out required fields (NO document title required)
3. Creates project
4. Filename: "1234567890 - CD456 - OTH - 2025.json"
5. Document title field never appears

Scenario 3 - General Site Conditions:
1. User selects "General Site Conditions" from dropdown
2. Suffix is NOT required (special case)
3. Creates project
4. Filename: "1234567890 - GSC - 2025.json"

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
✅ Dropdown options are clear and professional
✅ No confusing document title requirements
✅ Clean, consistent filename generation
✅ Users see what they expect in the interface
✅ Backend gets proper codes for processing
