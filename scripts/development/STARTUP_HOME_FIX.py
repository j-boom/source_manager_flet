Application Startup Behavior Fix
================================

PROBLEM:
The app was loading the last visited page on startup, which could be confusing 
for users who might find themselves on a project view or other pages they 
weren't expecting.

SOLUTION:
Changed the app to always start on the home page regardless of the last 
visited page stored in user configuration.

CHANGE MADE:
File: src/controllers/app_controller.py
Method: run()

BEFORE:
    def run(self):
        self.main_view.show()
        
        # Navigate to the last opened page
        last_page = self.navigation_manager.get_current_page()
        self._handle_navigation(last_page)

AFTER:
    def run(self):
        self.main_view.show()
        
        # Always navigate to home page on startup
        self._handle_navigation("home")

BENEFITS:
✅ Consistent startup experience - users always know where they'll land
✅ Clean starting point for each session
✅ Avoids confusion from opening on unexpected pages
✅ Home page provides good overview and navigation options
✅ User can still navigate to recent projects or other pages as needed

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Every time the app launches, user sees the home page
- Home page provides access to all major features:
  - Recent projects
  - Create new project
  - Browse directories
  - Settings and other options
- Users have a predictable, familiar starting point

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- The navigation_manager still tracks the current page during the session
- Last page preference is still saved (in case we want to use it later)
- The change only affects startup behavior, not runtime navigation
- All existing navigation functionality remains intact

This ensures a consistent, user-friendly startup experience where users
always begin from the home page and can choose where to go from there.
